===== HRM Timing Analysis Test Script v2 =====
Designed to test home row modifiers with realistic typing patterns.

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Type NATURALLY at YOUR normal speed
- Typos are fine - we only measure TIMING
- If you mess up, keep going!

Press Control-C when finished.

=== Part 1: Baseline - Normal words with f and j ===
Type these words normally (no capitals intended):

draft shift craft after before offer buffer differ
just jump jolt jest join enjoy adjust major
effort different traffic affect suffer afford offer refer
major project inject subject adjust reject object eject

=== Part 2: Sentence-initial capitals (the problem area) ===
Start each sentence with a capital using j+key. These are where "jgood" happens:

Good morning. Great to see you. Go ahead and start.
What do you think? When should we begin? Where is it?
Should we change back? See if this works. Start here.
Every time this happens. Enter the command. Edit the file.
Did you notice? Don't forget. Delete that line.

=== Part 3: Technical vocabulary you actually type ===
Type these programming and keyboard terms:

keymap config layer modifier binding behavior
Command-backspace Control-C Shift-Enter Alt-Tab
ZMK QMK firmware parameter threshold timing
sticky shift one-shot hold-tap tapping-term

=== Part 4: Mixed capitals mid-sentence ===
Capital letters that appear after punctuation or mid-thought:

I'm seeing issues with Good where we see jgood instead.
The Command key and Shift key need different timing.
Check the LAYER_Typing and RSFT parameters carefully.
Use balanced flavor, not tap-preferred for overlap.

=== Part 5: f as Shift with right hand ===
Hold f, tap right-hand keys for capitals:

Python JavaScript TypeScript Node NPM Yarn
Happy Help Home Hold Here How High
Just Keep Looking Maybe Never Open
Upload Install Unify Improve Optimize

=== Part 6: Quick sentences with mixed HRM usage ===

Just checking if the modifier works properly.
Good question about the keyboard configuration.
Should we adjust the timing parameters now?
What happens when you hold down the shift key?
Great, that seems to be working correctly.

=== Part 7: Realistic paragraph - type naturally ===

I'm seeing issues again with capitalization when using home row keys,
especially at the beginning of sentences or words like Good where we
see jgood instead. Should we change back to balanced from tap-preferred?
What if I want that to just act as a shift key? If tapped, then it is
a sticky shift, and if held it is as if you were holding down the key.

=== Part 8: Code and config snippets ===

#define INDEX_HOLDING_TIME 240
#define THUMB_HOLDING_TYPE "balanced"
bindings = <&mo>, <&kp>;
compatible = "zmk,behavior-hold-tap";
tapping-term-ms = <THUMB_HOLDING_TIME>;

=== Part 9: Fast flow - type as quickly as possible ===
This reveals real timing issues. GO FAST:

Just jump over and grab the keyboard config file.
Good settings should prevent false shift activation.
What timing values work best for your typing style?
Should the sticky shift decay be longer or shorter?
Edit the keymap and test the new behavior definition.
Great, now we can see if the changes helped at all.

=== Part 10: Problem patterns - rapid fire ===
These specific patterns often cause issues:

Good Good Great Great Go Go Get Get
Just just Jump jump Jersey jersey Join join
fjord fjord jeff jeff jelly jelly jest jest
flow flow from from after after effort effort

=== Part 11: Natural conversation ===
Type as if you're chatting:

So what does stumb do exactly?
Can you explain the difference between tap and hold?
What if I want longer sticky shift timeout?
Should I use balanced or tap-preferred flavor?
Good point about the keystroke overlap issue.
Just to clarify, the hold activates the layer right?

=== Part 12: Final flow challenge ===
Type this entire paragraph as FAST as you naturally can:

Good morning! Just wanted to check if the keyboard settings are working
properly now. Should we adjust the timing or is it good enough? What do
you think about changing the sticky shift to have a longer timeout? Great
question - the hold-tap behavior needs careful tuning. Don't forget to
test after making changes. Every keystroke matters when we're measuring
timing. Just keep typing naturally and we'll see what happens.

=== Done! ===
