===== HRM Timing Analysis Test Script =====
This script is designed to test home row modifier (HRM) timing for 'f' and 'j' as shift keys,
and space key combinations for quotes.

⚠️  IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
- Type NATURALLY at YOUR normal speed
- Don't worry about typos, spelling errors, or mistakes!
- We only care about TIMING, not accuracy
- Type in your natural "flow state" - errors are EXPECTED and IGNORED
- The analysis only looks at keystroke timing patterns, not what you type
- If you mess up a word, just keep going!

Press Control-C when finished.

=== Part 1: Natural words with 'f', 'j', and 'u' (baseline taps) ===
Type these words normally to establish your baseline tap timing:

fling fjordffle graffleffle waffle raffle baffle
jersey fjord ejaculate belief fjell fjord
jeff jeffery jefferson jeer jeans jealous jealousy
fromафт draft drift graft shaft
jump jungle jigsaw jargon jolt jostle

Test 'u' key specifically (to check for hardware issues):
under unity unique upload update usually universe
push pull supreme value cultureature ubuntu
unusual unusual unusual pursuit pursuit pursuit

=== Part 2: 'j' as Shift + Left Hand Keys (HRM holds) ===
Now use 'j' as shift with your LEFT hand keys. Hold 'j' then tap the target key:

Good World Estate React Typewriter Astonishing
Dear Friend Great Seeing Discuss ZoneXter
Quiet Wonder Erase Test Advice Science
Five Four Three Two One
Backstick Braces Around Caret ~tilde

=== Part 3: 'f' as Shift + Right Hand Keys (HRM holds) ===
Now use 'f' as shift with your RIGHT hand keys. Hold 'f' then tap the target key:

Python Unified Install Open Loving Kind
Happy Normal Many Joy Yonder Update
Item Phone Happy Lincoln Unity Navigate
Number Million Loop Keyboard Joyful
Pipe Backslash Period Comma Semicolon

=== Part 4: Testing 'j' as Shift (intentional capitals) ===
HOLD 'j' key and tap the letter to make it capital. Type these:

Good Good Good (hold 'j' then tap 'g' for each)
Nice Nice Nice (hold 'j' then tap 'n' for each)
World World World (hold 'j' then tap 'w' for each)
Estate Estate Estate (hold 'j' then tap 'e' for each)

=== Part 5: Normal 'j' words (should NOT capitalize) ===
Type these words normally - 'j' should just be 'j', not shift:

just just just (normal typing, lowercase)
jump jump jump (normal typing, lowercase)
jersey jersey jersey (normal typing with 'j' slide)
jigsaw jigsaw jigsaw (normal typing, lowercase)

=== Part 6: Space + m for single quote (') ===
Practice holding space and tapping 'm' to produce a single quote:

It's a lovely day. Don't worry about it.
I'm going to the store. She's not here.
We're happy to help. They're coming soon.
You're right about that. He's already gone.

=== Part 7: Space + n for double quote (") ===
Practice holding space and tapping 'n' to produce a double quote:

He said "hello" to me.
The book titled "Freedom" is great.
She whispered "thank you" quietly.
They announced "victory" loudly.

Now type some sentences that combine both quote types naturally:
"It's amazing," she said. "Don't you think so?"
He replied, "I'm sure it's fine." She wasn't convinced.
"We're ready," they shouted. "Let's begin!"

=== Part 8: Mixed HRM patterns (realistic usage) ===
Type this paragraph using your HRMs naturally:

Good morning! I'm typing this "test" to see how my Home Row Modifiers work.
It's really interesting to analyze the timing. Don't you think it's helpful?
My goal is to type "effortlessly" without errors. Jersey folks might say it's
"wicked cool" - and they're right! I believe this will improve my typing speed.

=== Part 9: Fast typing with potential HRM conflicts ===
Type these sentences quickly (this will reveal timing issues):

just jump over the jersey barrier
jefferson joked about jealous jaguars
belief in fjords is justified by geography
waffle raffle baffle shuffle muffle truffle

=== Part 10: Capitals with both f and j HRMs ===
Practice using both f and j as shift modifiers:

The Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over The Lazy Dog
Python Programming Is Really Quite Nice
Happy New Year To Everyone Everywhere
Justice Prevails When Truth Is Honored

=== Part 11: Quote-heavy text ===
Type this to test space+m and space+n combinations:

"Don't panic," he said. "It's going to be okay."
I replied, "You're absolutely right. We're fine."
She asked, "What's the plan?" and I said, "Let's go."
They shouted, "We're ready!" It's time to begin.

=== Part 12: The "flow state" challenge ===
Type this paragraph as FAST as you can, like you're in flow mode.
This will reveal the real timing issues:

Just jump quickly over the jersey barrier and grab the good waffle.
Jefferson believed that fjords are beautiful geological formations.
Don't worry about getting it perfect - we're just measuring flow!
It's really important to type this naturally and quickly.

=== Done! ===
Press Control-C to stop the logger.
