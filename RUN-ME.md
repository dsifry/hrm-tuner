# 🎯 Quick Start - RUN THIS

Everything is now set up! Just run:

```bash
./quick-start.sh
```

## What Will Happen

1. **Logger starts** - you'll see instructions
2. **Type the test** - open TYPING-SCRIPT-HRM and type naturally
   - **TYPOS ARE FINE!** We only measure timing!
   - Type fast, especially Part 11 (flow state)
3. **Press Control-C** when done
4. **Analysis runs** - shows your timing and ZMK recommendations

## If You Get Permission Errors

macOS may ask for accessibility permissions the first time.

Go to: **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility**

Add your Terminal app to the allowed list.

Then run `./quick-start.sh` again.

## Ready?

```bash
./quick-start.sh
```

That's it! 🚀
